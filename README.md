## Description

The homepage will request a number from the user. The program will return to the page, a bullet point list of numbers starting from 1 to the number indicated by the user. For every multiple of 3 in that list, "Ping" will be displayed instead of the number. If the number is a multiple of 5, "Pong" will be displayed. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, "Ping-Pong" will be displayed.
